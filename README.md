# React App Setup

This repository contains the code for a basic React app. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the React app, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Getting Started

To set up the React app, follow these steps:

```shell
# Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Install the project dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can access the app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the app in your default browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies into the project.
